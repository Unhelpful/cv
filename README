My own résumé in moderncv, with a modified version of the banking style
and an implementation of a subset of moderncv for HeVeA, a LaTeX-to-HTML
converter. moderncv.hva only implements one style and color, a blue splashy
style similar to classic and suitable for the web, and also an optional
plaintext mode producing markdown output.
